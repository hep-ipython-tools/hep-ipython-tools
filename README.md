# hep-ipython-tools
Package with reusable ipython tools and widgets typically used for HEP experiment code.

This package summerizes tools and widgets used for accessing the Belle2 software framework with ipython/jupyter. 
It can be reused for other experiments. To implement the functionality for your local software stack, overload the corresponding 
classes. For a simple example, see `simple`; for a more advanced setup see `ipython_handler_basf2`.
